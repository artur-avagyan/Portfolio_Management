The goal of our project is to study the financial markets, create a portfolio on 26/10/2021, manage it for the next 10 weeks with rebalancing each week. Each week we analyzed the dynamics of our stocks, based on them we performed the rebalancing. We used some time series prediction models for that (ARIMA, ARCH/GARCH). These steps are detailed in the Stock_price_team.ipynb and presentation.<br>
An interactive dashboard (Plotly Dash) has also been created for building a portfolio, through which we can see the dynamics of our portfolio over the next month. <br>
In general,  the process was very interesting, we learned how to manage a portfolio and follow the financial market.<br><br>
And during the proeject we have this dynamics for our portfolio:<br>
